Development
*****************
Test driven development is emphasized in this project.

C++ Unit Testing
=================
The drone core is written in C++. To test and verify its functionality,
the test framework `Catch 2 <https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2>`_ is used.

To run all unit tests::

    ./drone/tests/run_catch_tests.sh
